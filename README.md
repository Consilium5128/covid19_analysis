# covid19_analysis
To help predict future cases of Covid 19 using Machine Learning.

Covid 19 has been one of the most shocking pandemics in recent history causing devastating loss of life and property. It is crucial to track, understand, and predict the trajectory of this disease and in this project, I have tried to predict the trends of Covid 19 given some preliminary data with the help of Machine Learning. We have utilised Holt's method, Linear Regression, and Support Vector Machine Algorithms to predict and analyze Covid 19.
